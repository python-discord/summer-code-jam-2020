# Early morning internet (Melodic Manatees)
Welcome to early morning internet, an app that lets you kick start your day!

Tired of having the monotonous homepages that greet you at the start of your day? Our website plans to change that. We use the power of Django and the look of Bulma to provide features that allow you to customize your experience and quickly note ideas.

Some features include:

1. User specific profiles that let you tailor your experience.

2. Custom backgrounds, profile pics and feed preferences.

3. MultiTabs that can be customized and provide quick access to your favorite set of web pages. 

4. Clean look and ease of access to features powered by Bulma, an opensource framework based on on Flexbox. 


# Kick start your daily internet



## Installation

1. Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. **If running for the Python Dicord's CJ2020 Event:** Copy and paste the `.env` file sent to you at the root level in the same directory as `.gitignore`.

2. **If running after the Python Dicord's CJ2020 Event:** Create a `.env` in the same directory as `.gitignore`, enter the following 2 lines in the file. Replace each *** with the API key for the NY Times and OpenWeatherAPI.
```bash
NEWS_KEY=***
WEATHER_KEY=***
```
3. Create a user profile using the `register` button on the homepage.

Example: correct - `https://www.google.com/` incorrect - `google`
